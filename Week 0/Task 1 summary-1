RISC-V tapeout flow and SoC integration

From C model to SoC
The design begins with a system description written in C, and the same C environment is used to create testbenches that check the design. 
Hardware is then described in Verilog at the RTL level, covering the processor core and its peripherals or IPs. 
The RTL is synthesized into a gate-level netlist and combined with analog blocks and third-party hardened IPs to form the complete SoC. 
Standard ASIC steps follow, including synthesis, floorplanning, placement, clock-tree synthesis, routing, and making a GDSII layout that passes DRC and LVS checks.

Final chip and examples
The taped-out chip runs at practical speeds of about 100–130 MHz. 
The original C testbench is reused to validate the final silicon, keeping verification consistent from start to finish. 
Typical applications include smart wearables, Arduino development boards, TV electronics, and embedded controllers for appliances like air conditioners.

Key takeaways
Using one unified C testbench across the whole flow keeps the design consistent. 
The flow is: C specification → RTL (Verilog) → SoC integration → GDSII. 
Functional and physical checks at every stage ensure correctness, and RISC-V SoCs produced this way can be used in many real-world consumer and industrial products.
