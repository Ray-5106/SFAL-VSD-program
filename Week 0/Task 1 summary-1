VSD RISC-V Tapeout Program – Summary Document 

Instructor: Kunal Ghosh (VLSI System Design – VSD) 
 Focus Area: RISC-V Tapeout Flow and SoC-Level Integration 

 

1. Chip Modeling and RTL-to-SoC Flow 

Stage 1 – System Specification (C Model) 

The design process begins with a system description written in C. 

Functional verification and testbenches are also developed in C to validate specifications. 

Stage 2 – RTL Design (Verilog Model) 

Hardware functionality is expressed at the RTL level using Verilog. 

At this stage, both the processor core and its associated peripherals/IPs are modeled in RTL. 

Stage 3 – SoC Assembly & Netlist Generation 

The processor, digital IPs, and analog blocks are integrated into a complete SoC. 

Logic synthesis produces a gate-level netlist. 

Analog components and third-party IPs are used as hardened blocks (Hard Macros). 

ASIC Implementation (RTL → GDSII) 

Standard steps: synthesis, floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis (CTS), and routing. 

The final output is a GDSII layout verified with DRC and LVS checks. 

 

2. SoC Tapeout and Real-World Usage 

Stage 4 – Final SoC 

The fabricated SoC operates at practical frequencies of ~100–130 MHz. 

The same C testbench used at the start is reapplied for final silicon validation, ensuring design consistency. 

Example Applications and Platforms: 

Smart wearables (e.g., iWatch). 

Arduino development boards. 

Consumer electronics like TV panels. 

Embedded controllers in home appliances (e.g., Air Conditioners). 

 

3. Major Learnings 

A single unified C testbench ties together all stages of design, maintaining consistency. 

The structured flow: C Specification → RTL (Verilog) → SoC Integration → GDSII. 

At each stage, functional and physical verification ensures correctness before moving forward. 

RISC-V based SoCs are directly applicable in real-world consumer and industrial products.
