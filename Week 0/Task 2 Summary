Week 0 – Tools Installation and Test Run Summary  
Focus Area: SFAL VLSI Tools Setup and OpenLane Flow Validation

1. System preparation and environment  
Stage 1 – Host and VM configuration  
The development environment was prepared on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. 
System resources and package dependencies were verified and configured to support the VLSI toolchain and the Docker-based OpenLane flow.

2. Tool installation and verification  
Stage 2 – Toolset deployed  
The required toolset was downloaded, built, installed and verified. 
The installed tools are:
1) Yosys, 
2) Icarus Verilog (iverilog), 
3) GTKWave, 
4) ngspice, 
5) Magic, 
6) Docker, and 
7) OpenLane. The SkyWater sky130 (sky130A) PDK was installed for use with OpenLane.

Stage 3 – Verification procedure  
Each tool was validated by running version checks or minimal smoke tests. 
Yosys and Icarus Verilog were invoked to confirm synthesis and simulation readiness. 
GTKWave and Magic were launched to verify GUI behavior. 
ngspice returned the expected runtime output. 
Docker was validated with docker run hello-world. 
OpenLane was executed on the example design spm and ran through the flow producing signoff reports.

3. Test run and observations  
Stage 4 – OpenLane test run  
The OpenLane test run completed and generated signoff reports. 
A set of non-fatal warnings was recorded during signoff, namely power-grid scaling, a few blackboxed cells during STA, VSRC_LOC_FILES not defined, and some max-fanout checks. 
These warnings are documented for follow-up optimization but do not invalidate the successful installation or the functional test.

4. Proof and repository evidence  
Screenshots, terminal logs and test artifacts have been collected and placed in the repository under Week 0 -> Images. 
These files provide visual evidence of tool versions, system checks, Docker verification, the OpenLane run log and the generated reports.

5. Key takeaways  
The VLSI toolchain is installed and integrated. 
The successful OpenLane test run validates synthesis, simulation, waveform viewing, circuit simulation, layout tools and the OpenLane physical design flow. 
The environment is ready for design iterations and further optimization. Follow-up work will address the signoff warnings for signoff-level quality.
